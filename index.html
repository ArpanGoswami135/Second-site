                <p>Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in reducing child mortality in recent decades. Yet 1 child in
                    every 33 still dies from a preventable or treatable cause – half of these are newborns. The children
                    of Bangladesh also face malnutrition, child marriage, lack of education and more, risking their very
                    lives and futures. </p>
